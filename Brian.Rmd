My name is Brian Dillard, and with this page, I will tell you about myself!


* I am a PhD student in the ecology and evolutionary biology department at Cornell.
* I try to spend as much of my free time outside hiking, camping, and playing with my two dogs
* I have two dogs! Like the picture on the home page of my website they are also (usually) good.
